    The Windows App SDK is a set of new developer components and tools that represent the next evolution in the Windows app development platform. The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used in a consistent way by any desktop app on Windows 11 and downlevel to Windows 10, version 1809. 
    
    
    The Windows App SDK doesn't replace the Windows SDK or existing desktop Windows app types such as .NET (including Windows Forms and WPF) and desktop Win32 with C++. Instead, the Windows App SDK complements those existing tools and app types with a common set of APIs that developers can rely on across these platforms. For more details, see Benefits of the Windows App SDK.
